## About
This is the WTVim document init.vim. for [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) (python3 needed)

PlumageVim is an open source Vim setup configuration init.vim file that provide interesting functaions.


## Install PlumageVim
To use the PlumageVim setup, simply replace the init.vim in the path, or just replace the codings in the init.vim file. 

Open Neovim and run PlugInstall to install all the plugins in the setup.

👽NOTE:  you will need [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) to automatically install the plugins PlumageVim need!


##  Using PlumageVim
🌶️ There are some hot keys avalible (will continue update~):

press `F1` to enter | |--|  H-split mode
  
press `F2` to enter | | | | V-split mode

 `r`+`Enter` : Run the file in Repl
 
 `space` + `c` or `v` for copy and paste the line inside or outside the Vim window.
 
 `plin`in normal mode will run the vim-plug `:PlugInstall` command.
 
 
## Supporting Languages

🧠The WTVim is a setup based on Neovim. Therefore, all languages that Neovim supported can be supported.

👑However, the defult setting of `F1` and `F2` is now only for [Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia).
