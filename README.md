## About
This is the WTVim document init.vim. for [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) (python3 needed)

WTVIM is an open source Vim setup configuration init.vim file that provide interesting functaions.


## Install WPVim
To use the WPVim setup, simply replace the init.vim in the path. 

Open Neovim and run PlugInstall to install all the plugins in the setup.

👽NOTE:  you will need [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) to automatically install the plugins WTVim need!

🌶️ There are some hot keys avalible (will continue update~):

press `F1` to enter | |--|  H-split mode
  
press `F2` to enter | | | | V-split mode

 `r`+`Enter` : Run the file in Repl
 
 `space` + `c` or `v` for copy and paste the line inside or outside the Vim window.
 
 `plin`in normal mode will run the vim-plug `:PlugInstall` command.
 
 
## Supporting Languages

🧠The WTVim is a setup based on Neovim. Therefore, all languages that Neovim supported can be supported.

👑However, the defult setting of `F1` and `F2` is now only for [Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia).
